Lab 7
================

## PSY V0500 Statistical Methods in Psychology

## Kevin R Foster, Colin Powell School, the City College of New York, CUNY

For this lab, take the “look at HHS data on kids mental health” file
that I shared on Slack, along with that data from Household Pulse
Survey, and look at other variables that you think should be included in
predicting whether children are assessed as needing mental health
services. What do you think are important influences and moderators?
(There might be some I had included that you decide to drop, as well)

Please run both OLS `lm()` models and logit
`glm(..., family = binomial)` models. Try different interactions. The
homework will ask you to go back and create some graphs to help show the
patterns you’re finding.
