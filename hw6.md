*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. Iâ€™ll put a HW
channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github
there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the
assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of
your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Complete Lab 5. Impress me.
3.  In Lab 5 I mentioned some papers written by faculty here, looking at
    some of the correlates of cannabis use. Pick one, read it, write a
    one-paragraph summary and propose a way to use some of this BRFSS
    data to extend one of their findings. (And look through their
    bibliography to think of other papers to read.)
