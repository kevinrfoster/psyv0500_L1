*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I’ll put a HW
channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github
there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the
assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of
your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Complete Lab 7. Impress me. Show some additional influences and
    moderators, both in the prediction models and some graphs.
3.  Read a couple papers related to your proposed final project (you can
    use PsychInfo or Psych Articles, databases that our library has).
    Write a short one-paragraph summary of each. What data does the
    paper use? (Find papers that use similar data) What statistics do
    they evaluate?
