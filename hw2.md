## Kevin R Foster, Colin Powell School, the City College of New York, CUNY

*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I’ll put a HW
channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github
there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the
assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of
your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic
    test by Mar 10
3.  Complete Lab 1. I trust that you can now replicate the commands
    there, so no need to demonstrate that. Instead show that you can go
    farther. Show some other interesting correlates of depression
    diagnosis. Explain why they are interesting. If you’re up to it,
    impress me by additionally calculating some statistics as well, to
    go along with those interesting correlations.
4.  (this part to be done before class) To prepare for Lab 2, modify the
    dice that I gave you (you are welcome to modify additional dice if
    you’d like). You can try various ways to play with – sanding,
    filing, heating, drilling, gluing, squeezing or whatever – to see if
    you can adjust which numbers come up more often. Roll at least 20
    times and record the outcome in an electronic format. Read over Lab
    2 to get an idea about what we’ll be doing.

*The dice example is from Andrew Gelman’s book on Teaching Stats.*
