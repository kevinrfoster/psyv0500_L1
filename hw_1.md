*Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an
identical computer file to the rest of your study group. I’ll put a HW1
channel on Slack and you should, ideally, put a link to your github
there. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the
assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of
your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*

1.  What are the names of the people in your study group?
2.  Work on the Hawkes stats review - you must complete the diagnostic
    test by Mar 10
3.  Open up R (on laptop or cloud). Replicate the commands given in the
    lecture notes *R Basics for Lecture 1* and *Lecture 1 A* to do some
    simple stats on the BRFSS data. Find something else interesting,
    that you learned from the data. Are there surprises for you? We will
    use this same data for a few exercises so it’s worth getting deeper
    into it.
